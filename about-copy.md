About this project

I tend to do a fair bit of design during any given project and it was frustrating that a fair amount of work and the content that results not working for me in some capacity. This project is a first iteration with the objective of showcasing and showing movement in the design space.

**Why not Instagram, Dribble or Behance?**

Each of these platforms has a culture and expectation associated with their content where as a website is a clean slate. As I wanted this to be a catch all for a breath of content in the design space I did not want to have to taking into account the personality of the platform and whether what I was posting meat with the audience expectation.

## Roadmap

- sort feature
